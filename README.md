# DeadWood_C-Sharp
Basically a C# implementation of Deadwood based on my school project (https://github.com/YuloLeake/school_projects/tree/master/deadwood) to learn and test out various C# and .NET stuff.

TODO:
* Make a command-line version of the game (model)
* Make a GUI version of the game using MVC (view and controller)
* Make an Unity version of the game
* Test out various ways of holding data (XML, JSON, SQL, etc.)
